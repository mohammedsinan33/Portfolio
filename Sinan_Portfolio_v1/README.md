# My Interactive 3D Portfolio

Welcome to the source code for my personal portfolio website. This isn't just a static page; it's a fully interactive and dynamic web experience designed to showcase my skills in modern web development. The project is built from the ground up with a focus on fluid animations, 3D graphics, and a seamless user experience.

## About The Project

This portfolio was created to be more than just a digital resume. It's a testament to my passion for creating beautiful, functional, and engaging web applications. The entire interface is designed to be fluid and responsive, reacting to user interactions in real-time. From the animated water background to the subtle 3D tilt of the content, every element is crafted to provide a memorable experience.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Interactive Water Background:** A dynamic, shader-based water simulation built with **Three.js** that ripples and flows in response to cursor movement.
* **Fluid 3D Motion:** The entire content area has a subtle 3D tilt that follows the cursor, creating a sense of depth and parallax.
* **Smooth Scroll Animations:** As you scroll, each section and its components gracefully animate into view, creating a smooth and polished browsing experience.
* **Dark & Light Mode:** A sleek, theme-aware design with a seamless toggle between dark and light modes. The UI and even the 3D background adapt to the chosen theme.
* **Active Section Highlighting:** The navigation bar intelligently highlights the section you are currently viewing.
* **Animated Preloader:** A minimalist loading screen ensures all assets are ready before the main content is revealed.
* **Fully Responsive:** The layout is optimized for all screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktop monitors.
